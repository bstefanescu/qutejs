1. Be able to declare private templates in JSQ files?
2. Should we support something like x-html but for jsq?
3. use setAsap instead of setTimeout in update queue?
4. update queue must split jobs in async parts - one async part per child component

Tests:
- x-toggle
- x-bind: and x-on: and :attr
- event listener & emit & x-listeners
- watch
- properties binding
- expressions
- styles
- lifecycle
- context
- message bus
- Qute facade - creating new components
- router

- move more functions to @qutejs/test-utils
