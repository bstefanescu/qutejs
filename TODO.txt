0. MOVE qub outside
1. remove 'm' from compiler vars .. use '$$' for current model? ($ is the rendering instance)
2. impl if / else if / else
3. impl switch / case?
4. if, view etc should be aliases to x-view x-if etc (or q:if q:view ?)
5. Be able to use {} for special expr attributes (and not only '' and "")
6. Be able to declare private templates in JSQ files?
7. Should we support something like x-html but for jsq?
