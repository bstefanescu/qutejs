- refactor doc sidebar:

- cleanup playground stored scripts? - TODO list not working
- cleanup dev release:
	- add bubble
	- test runtime size with error messages
- dist releases - use always qute- and not qutejs-

- there is a difference on using x-listeners on vm vs functional comp. => on vm, listeners are always registered on the root element. Explicitely Using x-listeners inside a VM template will register the listeners twice. On functional components you must explicitely use x-listeners to register the listeners ...

1. move more functions to @qutejs/test-utils
2. Be able to declare private templates in JSQ files?
3. use setAsap instead of setTimeout in update queue?
4. optimize update queue -> split runs of update in several async chunks? (one chunk per component?)
6. redux/flux integration as an example?
7. use a dirty prop on VM so that when disconnected and reconnected to automatically update if dirty?

Tests:
- x-toggle
- x-bind: and x-on: and :attr
- event listener & emit & x-listeners
- watch
- properties binding
- expressions
- styles
- lifecycle
- context
- message bus
- Qute facade - creating new components
- router


Docs:
- example with nesting through tag and slot


TEST: view / if / for - update propagated inside the own rendering?
